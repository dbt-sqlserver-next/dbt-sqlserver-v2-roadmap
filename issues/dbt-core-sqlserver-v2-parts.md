# SQL Server Fusion adapter: "Part N" sub-issue series

Mirrors the structure of the ClickHouse Fusion rollout
([#14607](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/issues/14607) and its
series) referenced in dbt-labs/dbt#15714.

## Why these live on the fork, not on `dbt-labs/dbt`

Originally drafted against `dbt-labs/dbt` (same repo as #15714), but
that's wrong for two reasons:

- GitHub's `Closes #N` auto-linking only works within a single repo. The
  PRs implementing each part get opened against
  `dbt-sqlserver-next/dbt-core:sqlserver-v2-port` (the work can't land on
  upstream `main` piecemeal — see `plan/README.md` "Branching strategy"),
  so an issue on `dbt-labs/dbt` could never actually be closed by them.
- Filing 10 granular WIP tickets on dbt-core's public tracker for work
  that isn't mergeable there yet is noise on someone else's repo. `#15714`
  is the one thing that belongs there — a single public touchpoint.

So all 10 are issues on `dbt-sqlserver-next/dbt-core`, cross-linked to
`dbt-labs/dbt#15714` via plain references (not native sub-issues,
since that link crosses repos/orgs).

Numbering starts at Part 1, not Part 0, because ADBC driver registration
(what ClickHouse's Part 0 covered) is already done for SQL Server — see
`plan/00-current-state.md` §2. Sequence is strict through Part 3 (each
unlocks the next crate's compiler errors); Parts 4–7 can happen in any
order once Parts 1–3 land.

Part 10 closing is what triggers opening the actual PR(s) against
`dbt-labs/dbt:main`, closing #15714.
